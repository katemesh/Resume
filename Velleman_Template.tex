Develop and execute research programs, experiment designs, and data analysis to further our understanding of how humans [communicate about their real-world surroundings] [combine speech, gaze, and gestures in face-to-face interaction]. 

Oversee project budget, navigate ethical review board, other institutional tasks based in Sweden

Coordinate an on-site field team in Oaxaca, Mexico to recruit participants and to devise, refine, and implement techniques for qualitative research (culturally-tailored interviews) and quantitative studies (direction-giving experiments fitted to the local culture and physical environment). 

Design experimental tasks for quantitative studies of the \emph{navigation $\cdot$ communication $\cdot$ interaction} strategies identified via discovery research.   

Conduct \emph{foundational $\cdot$ generative $\cdot$ discovery} research via home- and site-visits, using interviews and observations to generate\\ \emph{
$\cdot$ insights about participant recruitment in local populations \\
$\cdot$ spatial maps reflecting how participants navigate the local landscape \\
$\cdot$ insights about when and how participants combine conventional gestures with speech
}


Produce diverse reports of project findings as deliverables: e.g., expert-oriented publications and talks, public-facing media



%continuously collecting audiovisual recordings and geoinformation from moving participants during data collection hikes. 

Manage an international team of translators, transcribers, and human action coders to produce rich datasets of multiply-annotated audio-visual materials (5000+ \emph{communicative actions $\cdot$ direction-giving activities} selected and coded to date).  

Coordinate a cross-functional team of language researchers and data scientists to produce quantitative analyses of  \emph{face-to-face interaction $\cdot$ navigation and direction-giving strategies} using multiple statistical approaches (significance testing, regression, generalized linear models).

Designed and conducted survey research exploring cross-cultural differences in the interpretation of 15 common hand and facial gestures (target cultures: Israel and Sweden), generating a dataset of 37 participants' written interpretations, coded for thematic content/emotional affect.  


Synthesized current research on hand gestures in each subject culture, then selected video stimuli appropriate to both cultures, producing a stimulus set of NN videos. 

Created open-ended interview questions about the meaning of the gestures, and managed an international team of linguists to translate and localize the questions using MTPE (machine translation post-editing)

Created and executed an interview flow (balanced stimulus presentation) using Qualtrix 

Generated categories of participant responses 

Inter-rater reliability

Results were used to generate hypothesis for additional research studies on the interpretation of conventional gestures



Designed and conducted a quantitative research study comparing how users of two languages (Hebrew and Israeli Sign Language) manage visual attention while playing cooperative games: 

Coordinated with clubs, schools, and elder care centers to recruit 80 participants across a broad age span 

Trained language-matched (Hebrew and ISL) game facilitators and oversaw the collection of NN hours of video-recorded game sessions.

Developed a coding scheme to identify strategies for managing visual attention; oversaw a team of translators, translators and coders to generate a study dataset (NN+ attention-managing actions annotated)

Collaborated with a data science team to analyze the results  


• Designed and conducted survey research exploring cross-cultural differences in the interpretation of common hand and facial gestures (target cultures: Israel and Sweden), producing a dataset of 37 participants' written interpretations, coded for thematic content/emotional affect.

• End-to-end management of a quantitative study comparing how users of two languages (Hebrew and Israeli Sign Language) orient visual attention while playing a table-top game; results from 80 participants generated insights into language-specific interaction strategies.
